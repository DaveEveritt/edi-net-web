          <p>maximise the availability of usable information extracted from your raw utility data streams. Our system draws data (i.e. smart meter/AMR data) from your existing data management systems to generate information in a simplified, aggregated form.</p>
          <p>Simple summary reports enable the expert analyst to focus attention on buildings where usage appears abnormal.</p>

          <p>The interface is designed specifically to support a reactive approach to pinpointing low-cost, high impact operational issues such as the leaks, faults and other changes which are constantly occurring in a large building portfolio.</p>
          <p>It has highlight otherwise undetected issues that saved at least €50,000 in one City Council in just a few months.</p>

          <summary><h2>Decentralised monitoring</h2></summary>
          <p>the system can support a more decentralised energy management strategy, making links between the knowledge and enthusiasm of building users and the technical expertise of energy and finance professionals.</p>
          <p>Used carefully the system can be truly disruptive by providing the basis for developing distributed and transparent energy management workflows.</p>

      <h2>Collaboration in saving</h2>
      <p>
        Enabling building users to engage with their own building energy performance and to actively collaborate with energy management teams, provides a pathway to developing a more integrated, transparent and responsoive energy management function. This can significantly increase the capacity of public authorities to deliver a realistic sustainable energy policy—a timely opportunity to respond to the call for urgent action on climate change.
