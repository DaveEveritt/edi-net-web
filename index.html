      <h2>Quick, easy monitoring—<a href="#tierPricing">see plans</a></h2>
      <p>
        Monitoring systems for metering data are typically complex and costly.
        The EDI-Net dashboard makes monitoring <em>quick and easy</em> by automatically conducting a full analysis of your entire building stock every day.
        Allowing you to avoid spending time manually reviewing large volumes of data and to focus only on the data which needs attention.
        The results of analysis are presented as simple 'smiley faces' in an open user interface which makes them accessible to all stakeholders.
      </p>

      <h2>Collaborative saving and monitoring</h2>
      <p>
        Enabling building users to engage with their own building energy performance and to actively collaborate with energy management teams, provides a pathway to developing a more integrated, transparent and responsive energy management function.
        EDI-Net significantly increases the capacity of public authorities to deliver a realistic sustainable energy policy — a timely opportunity to respond to the call for urgent action on climate change.

        <h2>Usable information</h2>
        <p>Maximise the availability of usable information extracted from your raw utility data streams. Our system draws data (i.e. smart meter/AMR data) from existing data management systems to generate information in a simplified, aggregated form.</p>
        <p class="roboto-reg">Simple summary reports enable the expert analyst to focus on those buildings where usage appears abnormal.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Systematic savings</h2>
        <p>The interface is designed to encourage and enable a reactive approach to pinpointing low-cost, high impact operational issues such as leaks, faults and other regularly-overlooked changes that are constantly occurring in a large building portfolio.</p>
        <p class="roboto-reg">It can highlight otherwise undetected issues, saving at least €50,000 in one City Council in just a few months.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Decentralised monitoring</h2>
        <p>The system can enable support for a more decentralised energy management strategy, making valuable links by connecting the knowledge and enthusiasm of building users and the technical expertise of energy and finance professionals.</p>
        <p class="roboto-reg">Used carefully the system can provide a basis for distributed, transparent energy management workflows.</p>
