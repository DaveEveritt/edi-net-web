    By enabling building users to engage with their own building energy performance and to actively collaborate with the central energy management team, EDI-Net provides a pathway to developing a more integrated, transparent and efficient energy management function.
    This approach has the potential to significantly increase the capacity of public authorities to deliver sustainable energy policy.
    This is also a timely opportunity to respond to the current enthusiasm for action on climate change.
